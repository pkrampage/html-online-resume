    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>After 10 years working with government papers, 
        I was lucky enough to switch to an IT Support job, 
        where I discovered what I truly love: Web Development. 
        Getting our organization's website back online after it crashed 
        made me super interested in solving tech problems and managing systems. 
        Now, I'm fully focused on building good web applications.</p>
